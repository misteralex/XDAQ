# XDAQ - Virtual Appliance - Open Source Stack
XDAQ is an ecosystem of Open Source software for controlling Arduino based experimental data from sensors. It is avaiable as integration for Debian (Wheezy or Jessie releases), for Ubuntu and as Virtual Debian Appliance Builder. XDAQ includes Arduino IDE, Eclipse Mars C/C++ for Arduino and Python toolchains, some useful tools oriented to quality control with Doxygen and ArduinoUnit, to provide high performance and creative processes with openFrameworks C++ toolkit and Processing, to research with Python-based software, to make electronics accessible with Fritzing and more.

There are many way to use XDAQ:
- Get XDAQ as Virtual Appliance ready-to-go at www.embeddedrevolution.info
- Build Debianinux virtual environment and install all required package as described in Debianiux and XDAQ Guides
- Get xdaq-starter.sh script and install all required package in your Debian platform
- Use XDAQ as comprensive set of scientific tools currently available within Open Source world
- Meet XDAQ environment as interesting experimental virtual laboratory for your research
