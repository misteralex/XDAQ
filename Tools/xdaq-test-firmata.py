# @brief This is a short script to check Firmata commands
#
# @section DESCRIPTION
#
#  This small script support testing of Firmata protocol over standard
#  serial connection. It is an easy I/O board access through the library
#  <pyfirmata> over Python environment. This example provide blinking of
#  standard led connected to digital pin 13.
# 
#  This example is part of XDAQ v1.0 Project.
#  This code is in the public domain as well as XDAQ.
